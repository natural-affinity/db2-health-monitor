      DB2 Health Web Service Consumer Configuration File Schema

      This schema describes the structure of a configuration file used by 
      the DB2 Health Monitor Web Service Consumer to extract information
      from the login page, as well as store the address for utilizing
      the DB2 Health Monitor Web Service via WSDL.
      
      The Goal of the Configuration File is to allow an individual such
      as a web designer to modify existing HTML pages in the DB2 Health Monitor
      Web Service Consumer GUI, but at the same time make the reflect the change in the 
      Web Service Consumer without having to make a PHP code change.  The term 
      'code change' is used in reference to having to make a change to code that
      is only tag-based such as HTML or XML rather than in a language such as
      JavaScript or PHP.
