							First test to see if the 
							<a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceProducer" class="solo">
								Web Service Producer 
							</a>
							SOAP server is accessible by visiting the Web service URL.  
							
							<br /><br />
							The default for this application is:

							<a href="http://localhost/SOADemo/producer/db2soa.soap.server.php">
								http://localhost/SOADemo/producer/db2soa.soap.server.php
							</a>
							
							<br /><br />
							This URL might have to be modified depending on the Apache HTTP Server configuration used,
							the deployment architecture chosen, and the name of the root directory used.  
							
							<br /><br />
							A SOAP client would normally be used to perform the test, however, even without one, 
							the service should treat the visit to the URL as a bad request (that is, it should throw 
							a SOAP fault exception - an XML report stating that the service request was invalid).  
							Different browsers might interpret this differently.  If the test fails, continue with 
							this process.
							
							<br /><br />
							A page similar to the following should be visible:
							
							<br /><br />
							<img src="./images/service_fault.bmp" alt="SOAP Server - Fault Sample" />
							
							<br /><br />
							To test the WSDL document accessibility, visit the URL shown below.  Ensure
							that this URL is the same as the one listed in the
							<a href="./setup_sample.html" class="solo">Web Service Consumer config.xml</a> file:

							<br /><br />
							<a href="http://localhost/SOADemo/producer/DB2Health_Report.wsdl">
								http://localhost/SOADemo/producer/DB2Health_Report.wsdl
							</a>

							A page similar to the following should be visible:
							
							<br /><br />
							<img src="./images/service_wsdl.bmp" alt="Info Page Sample" />
						</p>
						
						<h1 class="head2green">Web Service Consumer</h1>
						<p>
							Upon logging into the sample application, ensure that at least the 
							<a href="./Widgets/Dashboard/class.dashboard.html" class="solo">Dashboard</a>
							is displayed.  It is also possible to examine the 
							<a href="./Widgets/SortableTable/class.sortabletable.html" class="solo">SortableTable</a>
							for health alerts, however, there may be no alerts for the specified database. Therefore,
							the table cannot always be used to determine if the 
							<a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceConsumer" class="solo">
								Web Service Consumer 
							</a>
							is operating correctly.  A working 
							<a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceConsumerGUI" class="solo">
