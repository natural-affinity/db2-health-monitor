						<h1 class="head2green">Using Zend Core for IBM</h1>
						<p>
			  				The <a href="http://www.zend.com">Zend Web site</a> hosts Zend Core for IBM, an automated 
			  				installer for PHP that provides full support for DB2 databases. The installer can automatically download and 
			  				install a DB2 client or the DB2 Express-C server. Zend Core also includes a Web-based 
			  				administration console for PHP. This console provides a GUI-based alternative to
			  				searching through the <b>php.ini</b> file for special configuration settings.
			  			</p>
			  			
			  			<h1 class="head2green">Ensuring the DB2 instance name is correctly identified for Linux and AIX</h1>
			  			<p>
							Ensure that the <i>ibm_db2.instance_name</i> variable in the <b>php.ini</b> file is set 
							correctly (db2inst1 is the default for a DB2 instance). This should happen automatically 
							during installation, however it is possible to check through the the PHP info page of the 
							Zend Core Control Center. See the sample ibm_db2 settings section of the PHP info page
							in the Zend Core Control Center:

							<i>extension=php_ibm_db2.so</i> (for Linux users).  Make sure that one of the above lines is present in the file
							and is not commented out.  Alternatively, look for the following setting in the
