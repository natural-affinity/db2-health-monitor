                  The DB2 Health Monitor Sample Application for PHP demonstrates
                  the concept of DB2 health monitoring as a service.
                  An XML-based health report is produced by a Web service
                  and it is broken down into a meaningful format for the user by the
                  Web service consumer.

                  <br /><br />
                  A walkthrough for using the DB2 Health Monitor Sample Application follows.
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <h1 class="head2green">Logging into the Sample Application</h1>
            <p>
              To gain access to health monitoring information, a valid username, password,
              port number, language, and database name are required.  The default port number,
              and database name have been loaded into text fields on the login page (these are not
              automatically detected).

              <br /><br />
              <img src="./images/login_page.bmp" alt="Login Page Sample" />

              <br /><br />
              The other important piece of information on the login page is the health detail
              drop-down box.  This allows the user to select the type of alerts that should
              be displayed throughout the session.  Possible types of alerts include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Database Manager Health Indicators</li>
              <li>Database Health Indicators</li>
              <li>Tablespace Container Health Indicators</li>
              <li>Tablespace Health Indicators</li>
              <li>All Health Indicators (all of the above)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Upon completing the login form, click the <b>Launch Application</b> button.
            </p>

            <h1 class="head2green">The Health Monitor Console</h1>
            <p>
              If the login is successful, a health monitoring console appears and after a few seconds,
              information about the database (including health alerts of the specified
              type) is displayed. The amount of time taken before the information is displayed can
              vary depending on the deployment model chosen (some deployment models can
              experience network latency) and the health report size.

              <br /><br />
              <img src="./images/service_console2.bmp" alt="Health Monitor Console" />

              <br /><br />
              The health monitoring console is divided into four main sections:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <b>Timestamp/Refresh Bar</b> - Shows the time that the last health update was
                received and allows the user to set the refresh interval or manually refresh
                the list of alerts.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Database Dashboard</b> - Shows information about the sample database including
                the host on which it resides, the number of reads and writes executed against it,
                the amount of disk space it is currently capable of using, and the amount of
                memory that is available on the system on which it resides.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Health Alerts Table</b> - Shows a summary of health alerts that can be sorted.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Health Details and History Accordion</b> - Shows the details or history of the
                alert that is currently selected in the above table.  Detail or history information
                can be toggled by clicking on their respective title bars.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h1 class="head2green">Viewing Health Alert Details</h1>
            <p>
              If any alerts are listed in the Health Alerts Table, you can view more
              detailed information about them by clicking on the row that represents the
              alert in the Health Alerts Table.

              <br /><br />
              A selected row is identified by its yellow background color.

              <br /><br />
              To view the details click on the details
              <a href="./Widgets/TitleBar/class.titlebar.html" class="solo">TitleBar</a>
              to toggle the details pane on the
              <a href="./Widgets/Accordion/class.accordion.html" class="solo">Accordion</a>.

              <br /><br />
              <img src="./images/service_console3.bmp" alt="Details Pane Sample" />
            </p>

            <h1 class="head2green">Viewing Health Definition Details</h1>
            <p>
              If there is any uncertainty regarding the type of alert and what
              it represents, it is possible to view the health alert definition details
              by clicking on the <img src="./images/button.bmp" alt="... Button" /> button while
              the details pane is visible.

              <br /><br />
              <img src="./images/service_console4.bmp" alt="Details Pane Sample" />

              <br /><br />
              A dialog window appears with the health alert defintion details.
            </p>

            <h1 class="head2green">Viewing Health Alert History</h1>
            <p>
              You can view health alert history in a similar way to health alert details.
              You must highlight the health alert in the table before you can view additional
              information. Instead of clicking on the details
              <a href="./Widgets/TitleBar/class.titlebar.html" class="solo">TitleBar</a>,
              click on the history
              <a href="./Widgets/TitleBar/class.titlebar.html" class="solo">TitleBar</a>
              to toggle history information.

              <br /><br />
              <img src="./images/service_console5.bmp" alt="Details Pane Sample" />
            </p>

            <h1 class="head2green">Controlling Health Alert Updates</h1>
            <p>
              There are two methods to control the rate at which health report
              updates are requested and received from the
              <a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceProducer" class="solo">
                Web Service Producer
              </a>:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <b>Auto-update Drop-down</b> - Allows the user to set a time interval at which
                updates will automatically be requested and received from the Web service.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Manual Update Button</b> - The refresh icon <img src="./images/refreshIcon.bmp" alt="Manual Refresh" />
                can be clicked in order to force an immediate update request to be sent to the Web service.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <img src="./images/refresh_bar.bmp" alt="Refresh Bar Sample" />

            <h1 class="head2green">Logging out of the Sample Application</h1>
            <p>
              There are several ways to log out of the sample application:
              closing the browser window, visiting a different Web-page other than
              the health monitoring console page, or by using the browser refresh
              button (not the console update button).  The rationale behind this is
              two-fold:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Because it is possible for the user to enter invalid login information
                or encounter an error if part of the sample is not setup correctly,
                it is important that the user be able to re-enter the information without
                having to deal with browser caching issues.
                A user often clicks the back button or refresh the page assuming
                that the sample application will be reset.  However, in some browsers,
                the page has actually been cached or the cookie tied to the invalid
                login information is still present or both.

                <br /><br />
                Tying the logout mechanism to each of these scenarios ensures a
                friendlier end-user experience.
              </li>
              <li>
                Secondly, tying the logout mechanism to the browser refresh button
                helps to illustrate the AJAX experience. That is, although the information
                on the Web-page is being updated, it is the individual components on the page
                (widgets) that are being updated, not the entire page itself.
              </li>
            </ol>
