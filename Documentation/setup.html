                  There are five main steps required to set up the sample application:
                  <br /><br />
                  <ol>
                      <li>Install a DB2 9 server product and create the DB2 sample database.</li>
                      <li>Install and configure PHP.</li>
                      <li>Install and configure the sample application.</li>
                      <li>Test the database connection.</li>
                      <li>Test the Web service.</li>
                  </ol>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <h1 class="head2green">Creating the DB2 Sample Database</h1>
            <p>You can create the DB2 sample database either: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Locally - On the same machine as the sample application.</li>
              <li>Remotely - On a different machine than the sample application.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1 class="head2green">Installing PHP</h1>
            <p>
              PHP can be manually installed and re-built with the DB2 libraries.
              Alternatively, download and install PHP
              <a href="http://www.zend.com/products/zend_core/zend_core_for_ibm">Zend Core for IBM</a>
              with pre-configured DB2 server support.
              <br /><br />
              If PHP has been manually compiled with DB2 server support you must configure the ibm_db2
              extension in order for the sample to work.  Detailed instructions are listed in the
              <a href="./setup_php.html" class="solo">Setup</a> sections.
              <br /><br />
              Similarly, you must also configure the SOAP extension in order for the
              sample to work.  Detailed instructions are listed in the
              <a href="./setup_php.html" class="solo">Setup</a> sections.
            </p>

            <h1 class="head2green">Configuring the Sample Application</h1>
            <p>
              After you install and configure the DB2 9 server, sample database, HTTP server, and PHP,
              configure the sample application.
              <br /><br />
              The
              <a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceConsumer" class="solo">
                Web Service Consumer
              </a>
              features an XML configuration file in which the
              <a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceProducer" class="solo">
                Web Service Producer
              </a>
              WSDL document address can be set without having to change any PHP code.
              <br /><br />
              Similarly, you must set the address of the SOAP server in the WSDL file (part of the
              <a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceProducer" class="solo">
                Web Service Producer</a>).
              <br /><br />
              After this, all you need to do is drag and drop the DB2 Health Monitor Sample
              Application into the publicly visible folder used by the Apache HTTP Server.
            </p>

            <h1 class="head2green">Testing the Connection</h1>
            <p>
              After everything is set up, test the connection to the DB2 sample database.  If the
              connection succeeds, leave it active to ensure that health monitoring data is being
              gathered on a regular basis.
            </p>

            <h1 class="head2green">Testing the Service</h1>
            <p>
              Finally, ensure that the service is functioning properly. This involves three steps:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Ensure that the Web service WSDL document is accessible through the HTTP server.</li>
              <li>Ensure that the Web service SOAP server is accessible via the URL in the WSDL document.</li>
              <li>
                Ensure that the
                <a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceConsumerGUI" class="solo">
                  Web Service Consumer GUI
                </a>
                displays health monitoring data.
              </li>
            </ol>
