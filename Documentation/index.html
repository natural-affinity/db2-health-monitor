                  The DB2 Health Monitor Sample Application provides a demonstration as to how
                  Web services can be built using PHP and consumed using PHP and AJAX.  All files and
                  directories in the sample are organized and named so that you can understand
                  what is necessary to create a PHP SOAP-based Service Oriented Architecture application.

                  Although the sample is designed for a multi-tier environment, it can be deployed on a single,
                  physical machine.  It includes setup instructions, architectural diagrams, file-level explanations,
                  code documentation, and JavaScript widget documentation for reusing
                  components in other Web applications.

            <h1 class="head2green">Purpose</h1>
            <p>
              The DB2 Health Monitor Sample for PHP illustrates how to write a PHP Web service that
              serves and consumes health monitoring data from a DB2 database.  It includes examples of how to
              perform the following tasks:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Create a PHP SOAP-based Web service using the native PHP 5 SOAP extension.</li>
              <li>Use an existing WSDL document with SOAP.</li>
              <li>Extract data as an XML document from DB2 using a single XQuery statement (pureXML&trade;).</li>
              <li>Validate user and XML inputs using regular expressions.</li>
              <li>Consume a PHP Web service using the WSDL document and AJAX techniques.</li>
              <li>Preserve user session information throughout AJAX updates.</li>
              <li>Create a set of AJAX-enabled, object-oriented, JavaScript widgets.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Rizwan Tejpar designed and built the DB2 Health Monitor Sample Application for PHP.
