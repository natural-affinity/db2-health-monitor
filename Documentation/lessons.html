									The DB2 Health Monitor Sample Application serves as a prime
									example for demonstrating how to create a PHP-based Web service, 
									and consume the produced data in a meaningful manner.
									
									<br /><br />
									While many lessons were learned throughout the development of
									the application, the highlights include:
									
									<br /><br />		
									<ul>
										<li>DB2 with XQuery</li>
										<li>Application Security</li>

						<h1 class="head2green">DB2 XML Capabilities</h1>
						<p>
							One of the highlights of the DB2 Health Monitor Sample Application is
							absence of XML DOM parsing within PHP in order to construct or alter the
							XML Web service data.  Instead, the sample application makes use of the
							SQL, SQL/XML, and XQuery processing capabilities of DB2 9.
							
							<br /><br />
							As can be seen from the DB2 server documentation, all of the Health Monitoring
							data is accessible from a set of User Defined Functions (UDF).  These UDFs
							return SQL-based data and are accessed using a typical SQL SELECT statement.
							Because the data is not already in XML and PHP is not used to build the XML,
							it is the DB2 engine that converts the data on-the-fly into XML when the query
							is executed.
							
							<br /><br />
							While the queries in the 
							<a href="./architecture_files.html#class.db.worker.query.php" class="solo">
								class.db.worker.query 
							</a> 
							class in the 
							<a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceProducerDB" class="solo">
								Web Service Producer DB
							</a> 
							package appear large, one can see that it is simply a set of smaller queries
							joined together to form a single XML document.  
							
							<br /><br />
							Initially, each of the Health UDFs were examined for relevant information, and data
							was extracted using traditional SQL queries.  Building upon this, each of the results
							of the SQL statements could be converted into its own XML document by switching
							the statement to SQL/XML.  The final step involved producing one large XQuery statement
							in order to join all of the smaller SQL/XML queries.  While SQL joins may seem complicated,
							combining SQL/XML documents is almost trivial in nature.  A closer examination of
							the large XQuery statement will show that by storing the mini-XML documents within 
							<b>$variables</b>, and <b>returning</b> them within a set of braces (<b>{ }</b>), the 
							XQuery statement automatically joins the documents together.
						</p>
						
						<h1 class="head2green">Security</h1>
						<p>
							The following security issues are discussed in reference to the DB2 Health Monitoring
							Sample Application:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Operating system authentication</li>
							<li>Translation of error messages</li>
							<li>Session hijacking</li>
						</ul>
						
						<b>Operating system user authentication and database authorization</b>
						<p>
							To protect data and resources associated with a database server, the DB2 server 
							uses a combination of external security services and internal access control information. 
							To access a database server, you must pass some security checks before access is granted 
							to database data or resources. The first step in database security is called 
							authentication, which requires proof that the user logging in is in fact themselves. 
							The second step is called authorization, where the DB2 database decides whether the 
							validated user is allowed to perform the requested action or access the requested data.
							Authentication of a user is completed using a security facility outside of the database. 
							The security facility can be part of the operating system or a separate product.
							On the other hand, authorization is performed using DB2 facilities. You can grant 
							authority to users or groups to insert new rows, delete rows, or only read data. 
							DB2 tables and configuration files are used to record the permissions associated with 
							each authorization name. The authorization name of an authenticated user and those of 
							groups to which the user belongs are compared with the recorded permissions. Based on this
							comparison, the DB2 database decides whether to allow the requested action.  
							
							<br /><br />
							Since authentication in the DB2 Health Monitor Sample Application for PHP is performed
							by the operating system it is imperative that the permissions for that account are
							set correctly.  Recall that this is a monitoring service, therefore only read permissions
							are necessary.  
						</p>

						<b>Translation of database error messages</b>
						<p>
							Typically, in database-centric applications, the application developer
							translates database-related error messages to avoid exposing any information
							regarding the nature of the queries that are being executed against the database.
							However, the DB2 Health Monitor Sample Application for PHP is specifically designed
							to be an administration console.  Therefore, it is necessary for the user to see
							the SQLSTATE codes and messages returned by DB2.  It is the administrator's 
							responsibility to ensure that such an application is available only to selected users
							with the correct permissions.  
							
							<br /><br />
							As far as the custom error codes and messages for this application go, it might be useful
							in the future, to make these part of the Web service.  While SOAP faults are normally
							thrown when an error occurs in the Web service, a set of custom error codes and messages
							embedded within the XML structure provides a consistent format for processing service
							data.  All consumers of the Web service, only need process a single
							type of XML document format.  If an extra function were created for each Web service
							outlining the possible error codes and messages that could be received (while the service
							is running), then service consumers could provide end-users with a better experience
							in terms of error handling.
							
						</p>
						
						<b>Input and Output Validation</b>
						<p>
							The DB2 Health Monitor Application for PHP follows a service oriented
							architecture.  In most situations, the 
							<a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceConsumer" class="solo">
								Web Service Consumer
							</a>
							and the 
							<a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceProducer" class="solo">
								Web Service Producer
							</a>
							are owned and operated by different organizations.  Regardless, both components,
							since they are separate applications, should treat each other as external applications,
							and should validate accordingly.  All data from external sources should never be trusted
							without validation.  Data received by the 
							<a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceConsumer" class="solo">
								Web Service Consumer
							</a>
							from a user
							and even the 
							<a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceProducer" class="solo">
								Web Service Producer
							</a>
							, must be checked.  Similarly, the 
							<a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceProducer" class="solo">
								Web Service Producer
							</a>
							must scan all input from the 
							<a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceConsumer" class="solo">
								Web Service Consumer
							</a>.
							
							<br /><br />
							In terms of the 
							<a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceConsumer" class="solo">
								Web Service Consumer
							</a>
							, it is not enough to use client-side
							validation mechanisms within the 
							<a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceConsumerGUI" class="solo">
								Web Service Consumer GUI
							</a>
							(for example, extensive JavaScript
							checking).  A hacker can easily submit a fake HTML form to the 
							<a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceConsumer" class="solo">
								Web Service Consumer
							</a>
							bypassing all forms of JavaScript verification.
						</p>
						
						<b>Session Hijacking</b>
						<p>
							As with most Web-based applications, the DB2 Health Monitor Sample for PHP
							makes use of sessions in order to preserve user login information across Web page
							requests.  In order for sessions to work correctly, both the server (that is, the webpage
							host), and the client (that is, the user of the Web page) must hold a piece of information
							that indicates that the user has logged into the application. In other words, both
							require a common, globally-unqiue session ID.  On the server,
							PHP Session variables are used to store the user's login information, and it is the
							place in which the session ID is created.
						</p>
						
						<table cellspacing="0px" cellpadding="0px">
							<tr>
								<td class="tableText" style="padding:5px;background-color:lightgreen">
									$_SESSION ['username'];<br />
									$_SESSION ['password'];<br />
									$_SESSION ['database'];<br />
									$_SESSION ['instance'];<br />
								</td>
							</tr>
						</table>
						<br />
						
						<p>
							On the client side, there are generally two methods for storing the session ID:
							the use of cookies or the Web page URL.  The HTTP protocol is stateless,
							meaning, that there is no method of persistance between Web page requests, and there
							is no method of uniquely identifying the browser.  Therefore, the server must either
							append the session ID to the URL of the requested page or must attach a Set-Cookie
							section, containing the session ID to the HTTP Response.
						</p>

						<table cellspacing="0px" cellpadding="0px">
							<tr>
								<td class="tableText" style="padding:5px;background-color:lightgreen">
									http://localhost:8080/SOADemo/main.html?PHPSESSID=4H5jX4y78Kl
								</td>
							</tr>
						</table>
						<br />
						<p>
							OR
						</p>
						
						<table cellspacing="0px" cellpadding="0px">
							<tr>
								<td class="tableText" style="padding:5px;background-color:lightgreen">
									GET / HTTP/1.1<br />
									Host: ibm.com<br />
									Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=4H5jX4y78Kl
								</td>
							</tr>
						</table>
						<br />						
						
						<p>
							Both of the methods chosen are prone to session hijacking. It is possible
							for a hacker to gain access to the session ID and thereby gain access to a user's
							active session.  The URL passing method is less secure in that, if a user
							accidentally copies their URL with the session ID and gives it to someone, their
							session can be hijacked.  However a session using cookies can still be hijacked since
							all of the cookie information is contained within the HTTP request.  All that a hacker
							must do is examine the next HTTP request sent to the server, and examine the cookie
							portion of the header.
						</p>
		
						<table cellspacing="0px" cellpadding="0px">
							<tr>
								<td class="tableText" style="padding:5px;background-color:lightgreen">
									GET / HTTP/1.1<br />
									Host: ibm.com<br />
									Cookie: PHPSESSID=4H5jX4y78Kl
								</td>
							</tr>
						</table>
						<br />						
										
						<p>
							The DB2 Health Monitor Sample Application for PHP is for monitoring purposes
							only.  With the right account permissions, the application and operating system access
							can be limited to read-only.  As a best practice, it is always
							a good idea to enable SSL when hosting a Web application in a production environment.
							This will prevent Web traffic from being sniffed while in transit.
