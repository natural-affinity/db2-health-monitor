                  In a typical Service Oriented Architecture setup, more than one physical
                  server is used to gather the requested data to be presented to the user,
                  and often, more than one application is involved.

                  <br /><br />
                  The DB2 Health Monitor Sample Application aims to simplify the concept behind
                  SOA by operating as a stand-alone application and using a single physical
                  machine deployment model.  However, it can be set up
                  in a multi-tier environment as shown in several of the diagrams below.
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <h1 class="head2green">One Tier Deployment Model</h1>
            <p>
              The diagram below depicts a single physical server setup for an SOA
              application.  While this is not the typical scenario, the DB2 Health
              Monitor Sample Application, with its lightweight technology, and even with its
              accompanying software, can still operate successfully on a single desktop PC.  A diagram
              showing this scenario, where the Web server and data server reside on the same machine can be
              found below:

              <br /><br />
              <img src="./images/single_deployment_architecture.bmp" alt="Single Machine Deployment" />
            </p>

            <h1 class="head2green">Two Tier Deployment Model</h1>
            <p>
              The diagram below depicts a two-tier setup for an SOA application.  This scenario places
              the client components (that is, the
              <a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceConsumerGUI" class="solo">
                Web Service Consumer GUI
              </a>
              and the
              <a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceConsumer" class="solo">
                Web Service Consumer
              </a>
              ) on the first-tier, and
              places all server components (that is, the
              <a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceProducer" class="solo">
                Web Service Producer
              </a>,
              <a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceProducerDB" class="solo">
                Web Service Producer DB
              </a>,
              and DB2 9 server) on the second-tier.  For the
              <a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceProducer" class="solo">
                Web Service Producer
              </a>,
              the DB2 9 server and database are always local (that is, on the second-tier).

              <br /><br />
              This scenario is possible and practical at the same time due to the lightweight, PHP-based
              service that sits on the data server.

              <br /><br />
              <img src="./images/dual_deployment_architecture.bmp" alt="Dual Machine Deployment" />
            </p>

            <h1 class="head2green">Three Tier Deployment Model</h1>
            <p>
              The diagram below depicts a traditional three-tier setup where separate machines
              are allocated for each aspect of the architecture. That is, a Web server to host
              the
              <a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceConsumer" class="solo">
                Web Service Consumer
              </a>and
              <a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceConsumerGUI" class="solo">
                Web Service Consumer GUI
              </a>, a Web server to host the
              <a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceProducer" class="solo">
                Web Service Producer
              </a>and
              <a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceProducerDB" class="solo">
                Web Service Producer DB
              </a>, and a
              data server to host the required database.  In this case, the second-tier would
              require a copy of the DB2 9 client to communicate with the DB2 9 server and the database
              would have to be catalogued on this server.  In other words, this scenario shows the
              <a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceProducer" class="solo">
                Web Service Producer
              </a>
              being able to provide health monitoring information about any remote DB2 9 database.

              <br /><br />
              While any one of these tiers may have multiple physical servers for duplication purposes
              (for avoiding a single point of failure and to handle heavy Web traffic), the diagram
              below shows the simplest scenario:
