						<h1 class="head2green">Creating the Database using the Command Line Processor (CLP)</h1>			
						<p>
							Once the DB2 server is installed, verify the installation by creating a sample database 
							and running SQL commands to retrieve health data. The database that is created to 
							verify the installation is the same database used by the DB2 Health Monitor Sample 
							Application for PHP.
							
							<br /><br />
							To create the database:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Log on to the system using the DB2 instance user ID that was created while installing
							    the DB2 server (on Linux systems the default user ID is db2inst1).  
								On Windows, use either a Windows administrator ID or the ID specified during 
								installation.
							</li>
							<li>
								Enter the db2sampl command to create the SAMPLE database using the <code>-sql</code>
								and <code>-xml</code> options to ensure that both SQL and XML sample data is created. 
								
								<br /><br />	
								<table cellspacing="0px" cellpadding="0px">
									<tr>
										<td class="tableText" style="padding:5px;background-color:lightgreen">
											<code class="section">
												db2sampl -sql -xml
											</code>			
										</td>
									</tr>
								</table>
								
								<br />
								This command might take a few minutes to process and will display status messages 
								during execution similar to those shown below:
								
								<br /><br />
								<table cellspacing="0px" cellpadding="0px">
									<tr>
										<td class="tableText" style="padding:5px;background-color:lightgreen">
											Creating database &ldquo;SAMPLE&rdquo;...<br />
											Connecting to database &ldquo;SAMPLE&rdquo;...<br />
											Creating tables and data in schema &ldquo;TEJPAR&rdquo;<br />
											Creating tables with XML columns and XML data in schema 
											&ldquo;TEJPAR&rdquo;...<br /><br />
											'db2sample' processing complete.		
										</td>
									</tr>
								</table>
																
								<br />
								The SAMPLE database is automatically cataloged with the database alias SAMPLE 
								when it is created.
							</li>
							<li>
								Enter the following DB2 command from a DB2 command window to connect to the SAMPLE 
								database:
								
								<br /><br />
								<table cellspacing="0px" cellpadding="0px">
									<tr>
										<td class="tableText" style="padding:5px;background-color:lightgreen">
											<code class="section">
												db2 connect to sample
											</code>			
										</td>
									</tr>
								</table>
								
								<br />
								A message similar to the following indicates a successful connection to the 
								database:
								
								<br /><br />
								<table cellspacing="0px" cellpadding="0px">
									<tr>
										<td class="tableText" style="padding:5px;background-color:lightgreen">
											Database Connection Information<br /><br />
											Database Server = DB2/NT 9.1.0<br />
											SQL authorization ID = TEJPAR<br />
											Local database alias = SAMPLE	
										</td>
									</tr>
								</table>	
								<br />							
							</li>
							<li>
								While still connected to the database, type the following in the DB2 command
								window:
								
								<br /><br />
								<table cellspacing="0px" cellpadding="0px">
									<tr>
										<td class="tableText" style="padding:5px;background-color:lightgreen">
											<code class="section">
												db2 select * from table(health_db_hi('',-1)) as t
											</code>			
										</td>
									</tr>
								</table>	
								
								<br />
								Health alerts take time to generate and therefore, it is possible for zero records
								to be returned when the above command is executed.  If no data is present, wait
								5 to 30 minutes before trying the command again.  However, a zero records 
								returned message still indicates that the command executed 
								successfully.  The end of the output may appear as follows:
								
								<br /><br />
								<table cellspacing="0px" cellpadding="0px">
									<tr>
										<td class="tableText" style="padding:5px;background-color:lightgreen">
											0 record(s) selected
										</td>
									</tr>
								</table>								
							</li>
						</ol>

						<h1 class="head2green">Cataloging the Database from a DB2 client</h1>			
						<p>
							If the DB2 server is on the same machine as the HTTP server that hosts the Web service, 
							it is not necessary to catalog the sample database.
				
							<br /><br />
							If the DB2 server is on a separate machine from the HTTP server, it is necessary to 
							install a DB2 client on the same machine as the HTTP server.  Installing Zend Core for 
							IBM will provide an option to take care of this. Alternatively, it is possible to download
							and install a DB2 client from another source.			
							
							<br /><br />
			  				After a DB2 client is installed, catalog the remote DB2 server and identify the DB2 database.  
			  				The easiest way to do this is to use the DB2 Configuration Assistant. 
			  				It can automatically search the local network for DB2 servers to assist in the setup.		
						</p>

						<h1 class="head2green">Creating a Direct TCP/IP Connection to a Remote Server</h1>			
						<p>
			 				You can connect to a server through a client or directly to a TCP/IP port.
			  				If a direct TCP/IP connection is chosen, the hostname and port number of the 
			  				machine that houses the database server must be completed.  For a DB2 server, the default 
			  				port number is 50000, but it can be changed.  If the DB2 database is cataloged 
			  				locally on the client (that is, the DB2 server and HTTP server are on separate machines), 
			  				determine the TCP/IP port number being used by 
			  				the database server by running the db2 list node directory command:
			  			</p>  				
						<table cellspacing="0px" cellpadding="0px">
							<tr>
								<td class="tableText" style="padding:10px;background-color:lightgreen">
									<code class="section">
										db2 list node directory
									</code>			
								</td>
							</tr>
						</table>
						<br />		  				 			
						<p>
			  				Running the command will return the results similar to the following:
			  			</p>	
						<table cellspacing="0px" cellpadding="0px">
							<tr>
								<td class="tableText" style="padding:10px;background-color:lightgreen">
									Node Directory<br />
									Number of entries in the directory = 1<br /><br />
									Node 1 entry:<br />
									Node name = DB2<br />
									Comment =<br />
									Directory entry type = LOCAL<br />
									Protocol = TCPIP<br />
									Hostname = sample.ibm.com<br />
									Service name = 50000<br />	
								</td>
							</tr>
						</table>	
						<br />			
						<p>
							If the DB2 database is not cataloged, run the following command to
							determine the value of SVCENAME: 
						</p>			
						<table cellspacing="0px" cellpadding="0px">
							<tr>
								<td class="tableText" style="padding:10px;background-color:lightgreen">
									<code class="section">
										db2 get dbm cfg
									</code>			
								</td>
							</tr>
						</table>	
						<br />						
						<p>
							If SVCENAME is not a numeric value 
							(indicating a port number), then go to /etc/services (on Linux) or 
							\WINDOWS\System32\drivers\etc\services (on Windows) to lookup the port 
							mapping for that service name. 			  					
			  			</p>
		  
			  			<h1 class="head2green">Database schema</h1>
						<p>			  
							A database schema is a logical collection of objects within a database (for example, 
							tables and views).  A schema lets you create multiple instances of the same object 
							without having to create a new database.  Therefore, multiple applications can store 
							data in a single database without encountering namespace collisions.
							
							<br /><br />
							By default, the DB2 sample database is created under a schema name that corresponds 
							to the username used to create the sample database. On a Linux system, the 
							default schema name is db2inst1.
