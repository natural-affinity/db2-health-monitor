							To deploy the sample application, place the unzipped application (containing

						</p>

						<h1 class="head2green">SOADemo Folder</h1>
						<p>												
							This is the root directory of the DB2 Health Monitor Sample Application.  It houses all 
							other directories for the application, as well as all of the 
							<a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceConsumerGUI" class="solo">
								Web Service Consumer GUI
							</a> 
							files.

							<a href="./architecture_files.html#DB2Health_Report.wsdl" class="solo">

							<a href="./architecture_deploy.html" class="solo">Deployment Models</a>), this root

						<h1 class="head2green">Consumer Folder</h1>
						<p>												
							This directory holds all of the

						<h1 class="head2green">Docs Folder</h1>
						<p>
							This directory holds the code documentation for all PHP components of the DB2 Health 
							Monitor Sample Application for PHP, as well as the configuration file that was used
							with the PHPDocumentor tool in order to generate it.  The directory also contains
							IBM licensing information for the sample application.  This directory is not required
							by any of the sample application components, however, a copy should be placed
							on all tiers (See 
							<a href="./architecture_deploy.html" class="solo">Deployment Models</a>), so that
							developers and application users understand their usage rights.
						</p>			
		
						<h1 class="head2green">Images Folder</h1>
						<p>												
							This directory holds all images required by the DB2 Health Monitor Sample Application.  
							In any multi-tier architecture chosen (See 
							<a href="./architecture_deploy.html" class="solo">Deployment Models</a>), this directory 
							is placed on the first-tier Web server.
						</p>	
						
						<h1 class="head2green">Include Folder</h1>
						<p>												
							This directory holds all third-party packages required by the DB2 Health Monitor Sample
							Application.  In this case, no third-party packages are used.

						<h1 class="head2green">Producer Folder</h1>
						<p>
