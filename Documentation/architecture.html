						<h1 class="head2green">Service Oriented Architecture</h1>
						<p>
							SOA is a concept that revolves around providing information as a service.
							SOA applications require that the information be presented as XML (although JSON
							services now exist and are becoming increasingly popular).
							
							<br /><br />
							Traditionally, SOA applications gather their data from some source (most likely
							a database) and use a programming language such as Java, C#, or PHP in order
							to build the XML documents and combine the data in a meaningful manner.  
							
							<br /><br />
							In order to make the XML accessible as a Web service, a WSDL document must be constructed.
							This document describes the functions (written using a programming language such as
							Java, C#, or PHP), as well as their complex XML input and output structures.  The WSDL
							document is also responsible for exposing these functions on the Web.
							
							<br /><br />
							The DB2 Health Monitoring Sample Application for PHP, unlike traditional SOA applications, 
							does not rely on XML DOM parsing in order to navigate and construct the XML document.  Instead, 
							the DB2 database engine accepts a single XQuery statement (with embedded SQL/XML statements) in order 
							to build the entire document within the database engine, rather than externally.
							
							<br /><br />
							Although DB2 can store XML natively, all of the data used in this sample is traditional
							SQL accessible and formatted data.  The DB2 database engine is used to convert it to XML 
							on-the-fly when executing the desired query.
							
							<br /><br />
							There are two key parts to any SOA application: 
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								A package to gather and assemble the required data as XML from 
								a known data source (that is, the
								<a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceProducerDB" class="solo">
									Web Service Producer DB
								</a>
								package).
							</li>
							<li>
								A package that contains the functions to expose on the Web via WSDL,
								as well as the SOAP server through which communication will occur (that is, the
								<a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceProducer" class="solo">
									Web Service Producer 
								</a>
								package), and the 
								<a href="./architecture_files.html#DB2Health_Report.wsdl" class="solo">DB2Health_Report.wsdl</a>
								WSDL document.
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							To show how this Web service can be used in a practical sense, two additional
							packages have been developed.  These represent the requirements for consuming
							or utilizing SOA:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								A package that contains the SOAP client which will send requests to the 
								Web service and will receive the XML output (that is, the 
								<a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceConsumer" class="solo">
									Web Service Consumer 
								</a>
								package).
							</li>
							<li>
								To present the XML data in a meaningful format to the user,
								some type of graphical interface is required.  This represents the final
								package for Web service consumption (that is, the 
								<a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceConsumerGUI" class="solo">
									Web Service Consumer GUI 
								</a>
								package).
							</li>
						</ol>
						
						<h1 class="head2green">Package Communication</h1>
						<p>
							Although each package is composed of numerous parts, they can be grouped 
							into the categories of traditional design paradigms: presentation, 
							business logic, and data layers.  
							
							These packages communicate as follows:
							
							<br /><br />
							<img src="./images/package_architecture.jpg" alt="SOA Package Diagram" />

								To view the file-level breakdown of each package, view the 'File Breakdown'
								section of the documentation

						</p>
						<ol>

								page in the 
								<a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceConsumerGUI" class="solo">

								in the

							<li>
								The
								<a href="./architecture_files.html#db2soa.soap.client.php" class="solo">
									db2soa.soap.client.php
								</a> 								
								page creates a session for the client, and maintains 
								the session by redirecting the user to the

								</a> 
								page in the 
								<a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceConsumerGUI" class="solo">

								<a href="./architecture_files.html#main.html" class="solo">

								<b style="color:red">HTTP</b> in the

								</a> 
								page within the

								</a> 
								packages are both <b style="color:red">PHP</b>-based and exist on the same

								<a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceProducerDB" class="solo">

								The 
								<a href="./architecture_files.html#class.db.render.php" class="solo">

								class in the 
								<a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceProducerDB" class="solo">

								</a> 
								class in the 
								<a href="./architecture_files.html#WebServiceProducerDB" class="solo">

								<a href="./architecture_files.html#class.db.worker.query.php" class="solo">
									class.db.worker.query.php
								</a> 
								class uses a single <b style="color:red">XQuery</b> statement with embedded 
								<b style="color:red">SQL/XML</b> statements to query the DB2 database.
							</li>
							<li>
								Once processed, the DB2 database returns the result of the query as a single 
								<b style="color:red">XML</b> document.
							</li>
							<li>
								When the XML result is received, the 
								<a href="./architecture_files.html#class.db.worker.query.php" class="solo">
									class.db.worker.query.php
								</a> 
								class frees the memory associated with the result, and the 
								<a href="./architecture_files.html#class.db.worker.connection.php" class="solo">
									class.db.worker.connection.php
								</a> 
								class closes the connection to the database.  The XML result is then passed as a string 
								back to the specified <b style="color:red">PHP</b> function on the 
								<a href="./architecture_files.html#db2soa.soap.client.php" class="solo">
									db2soa.soap.client.php
								</a> 
								page which requested the data.
							</li>

								To return the XML result to the

								</a> 
								page, the data must transported via <b style="color:red">SOAP</b> over 
								<b style="color:red">HTTP</b>.

								Once the data is received, the 
								<a href="./architecture_files.html#db2soa.soap.client.php" class="solo">
									db2soa.soap.client.php
								</a> 								
								page validates the XML using the 
								<a href="./architecture_files.html#class.client.validator.php" class="solo">

								</a> 
								page over <b style="color:red">HTTP</b> 
								using the <b style="color:red">XMLHTTP</b> on-receive handler.
							</li>
							<li>
								Finally, the widgets on the
